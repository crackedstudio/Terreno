# Mondeto — how this repo works

This file records the conventions the repo already follows, so that work
landing from here on stays consistent with what came before. It is
descriptive: everything below is drawn from the existing history, CI
config and committed docs, not invented for this file.

Domain-specific conventions live next to the code they govern and are
**not** repeated here:

- [`apps/web/CLAUDE.md`](apps/web/CLAUDE.md) — logging rules (server OTel →
  PostHog vs. browser `console.warn/error`), `/dev` route gating
- [`apps/contracts/CLAUDE.md`](apps/contracts/CLAUDE.md) — UUPS storage
  layout, price formula, land mask, upgrade checklist
- [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) — index of migration, QA and contract docs
- [`docs/BASE_NIMIQ_MIGRATION.md`](docs/BASE_NIMIQ_MIGRATION.md) — the Celo/MiniPay
  → Base/Nimiq Pay move: what changed, what does not carry over, what is open

## Layout

pnpm workspace (`apps/*`) driven by Turborepo.

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `apps/web` | Next.js App Router app — the product. Most work happens here. |
| `apps/contracts` | Foundry / Solidity. UUPS proxy, one deployed map per continent. Also the Python land-mask tooling under `map/`. |
| `apps/subgraph` | Goldsky subgraph — earn/spend, time-ordered leaderboards, analytics. |
| `docs/` | Base/Nimiq migration runbook, mobile QA, contract proposals + audit remediation. Also the superseded MiniPay playbook/submission docs. |
| `scripts/` | Land-mask conversion helpers (Python). |

## Setup

Pinned: **pnpm 8.10.0**, **Node 20** (`packageManager` + `engines`, and
what CI installs). Use those versions.

```sh
pnpm install
```

`apps/contracts` depends on git submodules (`forge-std`,
`openzeppelin-contracts`, `openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable`). They are
not fetched by `pnpm install`:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive   # only needed to build/test Solidity
```

Common commands:

```sh
pnpm dev                       # turbo dev
pnpm --filter web type-check   # tsc --noEmit
pnpm --filter web test         # vitest run
pnpm --filter web build
pnpm -F web build:masks        # regenerate land masks into src/data/masks/
forge build && forge test      # in apps/contracts
```

## How work lands

Branch → pull request → **squash merge** into `main`. Nothing is pushed
straight to `main`; every commit in recent history carries its `(#NNN)`.

Because the repo squash-merges with `COMMIT_OR_PR_TITLE`, **the pull
request title becomes the commit message on `main`**. Write the title as
the commit you want in the log.

### Branch names

`<author-handle>/<slug>` — the author's own GitHub handle, and a slug that
describes the problem rather than the solution:

```
GigaHierz/deals-map-heatmap-tiers
GigaHierz/non-land-pixel-checkout-fix
csacanam/document-repo-conventions
```

Bots keep their own prefix: Renovate opens `renovate/<slug>`.

Type prefixes (`feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`) also appear in the
history. There was no cutover — the handle form has been in use since
mid-May 2026 and the two ran in parallel, with the type prefixes tapering
off through July and none since. Use the handle form; the type prefixes
are history rather than a live alternative.

### Titles

Conventional Commits, with a scope, in the imperative, stating the
outcome rather than the activity:

```
feat(profile): show LAND VALUE — current market value of owned pixels
fix(buy): block buying ocean pixels via long-press inspect path
perf(ranks): collapse leaderboard profile reads into one multicall
fix(analytics): treasury take = primary sales + resale fees, not volume × fee
docs(faq): answer the payout questions support actually gets
chore(deps): update posthog-js to 1.407.2
```

Types in use, by frequency: `fix`, `feat`, `chore`, `docs`, `perf`,
`style`, `test`, `refactor`, `build`.

Scopes are the product surface or subsystem touched — the recurring ones
are `buy`, `profile`, `ranks`, `deals`, `rewards`, `share`, `analytics`,
`nimiq`, `wallet`, `maps`, `geo`, `rpc`, `contract`, `contracts`,
`web`, `deps`.

### Pull request body

Two shapes coexist, and both are fine — pick by size of change:

- **Prose** — one dense paragraph, no headings. Used for most
  self-contained fixes (see #174, #177, #179, #181).
- **Sectioned** — `##` headings for larger or multi-part changes (see
  #172, #183, #184, #185, #186). The heading names vary by what the
  change needs (`What`/`Why`/`How`, `Problem`/`Fix`/`Why it's safe`,
  per-app sections); there is no fixed template.

On a substantial change the content below is invariant, whichever shape
you pick. A small self-contained fix is often a single prose paragraph
with no sections and no metrics, and that is fine — scale the body to the
change.

1. **The problem, with its evidence.** What was actually observed, not a
   restatement of the title. Production data is cited when it exists —
   e.g. #174 opens with *"PostHog day-2 data showed ~25 users hitting
   'Selected pixel is not land'"*.
2. **The root cause.** Why it happened, specifically enough that a
   reviewer can check the diff against the explanation.
3. **What changes**, naming the modules, hooks and helpers touched.
4. **Why it's safe** where the change carries risk — blast radius, what
   is deliberately left alone, paired changes made outside the diff.
5. **Verification, with numbers.** `tsc --noEmit` clean, "N tests pass",
   build passes. State what was *not* verified automatically and needs a
   manual check on the preview deployment — #186 and #176 both do this
   rather than omitting it.

Scope discipline is part of the convention: PRs state non-goals and
follow-ups explicitly (`## Scope / non-goals` in #172, `## Deliberately
not included` in #183) instead of widening.

## What CI checks

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on PRs to
`main` and on pushes to `main`. It calls the pm-kit shared baseline
(`celo-org/pm-kit` `ci-node.yml`), which runs the root scripts — the
required check is `ci / ci`:

```sh
pnpm run lint        # turbo run lint → apps/web `next lint`
pnpm run typecheck   # turbo run type-check → apps/web `tsc --noEmit`
pnpm run test        # turbo run test:coverage → apps/web vitest + coverage
```

Run all three before opening a PR — they are exactly what will fail
otherwise. Coverage floors live in `apps/web/vitest.config.ts` and fail
the test step on regression. Builds and deploys are Vercel's job, not
CI's (`run-build: false`).

`apps/contracts` and `apps/subgraph` still have no gated CI beyond this:
contracts has no package.json (Foundry), and the subgraph defines no
`lint`/`test` scripts, so the turbo tasks don't reach them.

Dependencies are managed by Renovate (`renovate.json`, extending
`celo-org/.github`), with `rebaseWhen: behind-base-branch` — added in #166
to prevent a recurrence of the `pnpm-lock.yaml` merge corruption repaired
in #162.

## Deployment facts worth knowing before changing behaviour

Detail lives in [`README.md`](README.md); what matters when writing code:

- The app targets **Base mainnet** and runs as a **Nimiq Pay mini app**. The
  Celo/MiniPay build is history — Nimiq Pay exposes a fixed EVM chain list that
  excludes Celo, so the maps are being redeployed to Base. Until that deploy
  happens every map sits on an undeployed sentinel and the UI renders none of
  them; that is the guard working, not a bug.
- One contract per map (world + 7 continents), registered
  in `apps/web/src/lib/maps/contracts.ts`. Adding or changing a map is a
  registry edit plus `pnpm -F web build:masks` — rendering, leaderboards
  and the active-map pointer all read the registry.
- Map visibility is a rollout env var (`NEXT_PUBLIC_REVEALED_MAP_IDS`),
  not a code change.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOLDSKY_SUBGRAPH_URL` points the app at the subgraph;
  unset falls back to the legacy live log-scan. Both paths need to keep
  working.
