/**
 * Server-side profit-and-loss for one wallet on one map: SPENT is the sum of the
 * wallet's own buys; EARNED is what actually reached the wallet when later
 * buyers took pixels off it. Values are 6-decimal "microcents" (the unit
 * `formatUSDT` renders).
 *
 * When the Goldsky subgraph is configured (NEXT_PUBLIC_GOLDSKY_SUBGRAPH_URL),
 * both numbers are a single indexed query (OwnerMapStats.totalSpent/totalEarned).
 * Otherwise we fall back to the legacy full-history `PixelsPurchased` log scan —
 * so this route behaves identically until the subgraph URL is set.
 *
 * EARNED is netted of the resale fee here rather than at either source, because
 * **both sources report it gross**. The subgraph accumulates `perPixelCost`
 * straight into `Owner.totalEarned` (`apps/subgraph/src/mapping.ts`, despite a
 * comment there claiming otherwise), and the log scan below does the same. On
 * chain the seller receives `price − fee`, so reporting either number as-is
 * overstates what reached the wallet by the fee rate — the app would state a
 * figure the player's own transaction history contradicts.
 *
 * Netting in the route also means no subgraph resync: it corrects historical
 * data that is already indexed. See `lib/resaleFee.ts` for the two
 * approximations that come with applying the current rate to lifetime totals.
 *
 * SPENT stays gross on purpose — the buyer really does pay the whole price.
