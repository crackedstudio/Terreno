/**
 * Server-side cross-map leaderboard.
 *
 * The global board has to read every map's full pixel state. Doing that on
 * the client meant ~8 heavy `getPixelBatch` reads from the phone, which on a
 * constrained RPC (MiniPay's injected provider) routinely failed and left the
 * board empty. Here the reads run on Vercel's network — fast, reliable — and
 * the phone fetches a small JSON of ranked entries instead.
 *
 * This is the lightweight stand-in for a full indexer: it still reads live
 * state per request (cached briefly in-memory), with no persistence or
 * historical queries. The Envio indexer remains the durable answer when we
 * need seasons / history / many maps.
 *
 * `?address=0x…` additionally returns `you` — the caller's rank + gap to the
 * rank above per board, located against the UNTRUNCATED ranking so a player
 * below the top-N still gets their standing. The full boards stay in the
 * warm-instance cache; the response ships only the top-N plus that one row.
