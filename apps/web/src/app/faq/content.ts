/**
 * Player-facing FAQ copy.
 *
 * Rebuilt from a week of support tickets. Nearly every "I wasn't paid" ticket
 * was a misunderstanding rather than a defect, with three root causes: payouts
 * land the day AFTER a campaign ends, campaigns don't run every day, and only
 * the board a campaign names gets paid. So REWARDS comes first — the onboarding
 * carousel embedded on the page already explains the game; this copy answers
 * the panic.
 *
 * Every item carries a stable `id` so support can send a player straight to one
 * answer (terreno.app/faq#payout-timing). Don't rename ids casually — they get
 * pasted into support replies.
 *
 * Numbers here (5% fee, ~30-day halving) were verified against mainnet
 * `feeRate()` and `config()`. They're per-deployment constructor values, so
 * re-check with `cast call` before editing — three different halving periods
 * were in circulation across this repo before this was written.
 *
 * Lives beside the page rather than inside it so `__tests__/app/faq.test.ts`
 * can import it without pulling in React (a `page.tsx` may only export the
 * default component and Next's own route config).

        id: 'which-board',
        q: 'Which leaderboard gets paid?',
        a: `It depends on the campaign. Some pay the ${BOARD_LABELS.AREA} board, some pay ${BOARD_LABELS.TYCOONS}, some pay ${BOARD_LABELS.EMPIRE}. The campaign banner says which board it pays and how many places. Topping a board the campaign didn't name pays nothing.`,

Three: that campaign paid a different board than the one you were ranked on. Four: your rank fell outside the paid places by the time the campaign closed. Rankings are recalculated for every campaign, so placing one day doesn't carry over to the next.`,

        q: 'How do I check whether I was paid?',
        a: 'Open your transaction history in Nimiq Pay and look for an incoming USDT transfer on the day after the campaign. Every payout is an on-chain transfer, so it is permanently recorded and cannot go missing. If there is nothing 24 hours after the campaign ended, contact support.',

        // Deliberately states no NIM amount. The size is a campaign setting
        // (GRANT_NIM_AMOUNT) and the claim panel prints whatever the server
        // resolves, so a number written here is one that goes stale the first
        // time the campaign is retuned — and a stale number in the FAQ is a
        // number support has to argue with.
        a: 'Yes. If you have never owned land here, Terreno buys your first plot for you, and the land is yours on Base from the first block. The claim panel shows exactly how much you are getting. You pay nothing, you need no balance, and you sign nothing. If somebody later buys one of those plots off you, the money goes to you exactly as it would for land you paid for.',

        a: 'It shows only for a wallet that has never owned land on any map — it is a starter grant, so one wallet gets it once, and buying even a single pixel uses it up. It is also a limited campaign: when the budget for it runs out the offer stops appearing. If you have never bought anything and still cannot see it, try again shortly — we may not have been able to check your wallet at that moment.',

        q: 'What if a pixel sits unsold?',
        a: `Prices don't climb forever. A pixel's price falls continuously while nobody buys it — roughly halving every 30 days, down to a floor. There is no waiting period and no sudden drop; it ticks down every hour. Turn on the deals view on the map to see which land is cheapest right now.`,

      {
        id: 'sniped',
        q: 'Can someone buy my pixel away from me?',
        a: `Yes — and that's how you get paid. Anyone can buy any pixel at its current price; there is no listing and no approval needed. The moment someone buys yours, you are paid in the same transaction: what they paid, minus the 5% fee. How much that is depends on timing. The instant a pixel is bought, its price doubles for the next buyer, then decays from there — halving about every 30 days. So a quick resale pays you close to double what you paid, while a pixel nobody touches for a long time gets cheaper for the next buyer, and pays you less.`,
      },
      {
        id: 'no-buyers',
        q: 'I bought a lot of pixels and nobody is buying them. Is my money gone?',
        a: `No. Nothing is locked and nothing expires. You keep the pixels and their color until someone buys them, and you stay on the leaderboards the whole time you hold — so you can still win campaign rewards. Anything you were paid for past sales is already in your wallet. Resale depends on other players, so a quiet day doesn't mean your land is worthless.`,
