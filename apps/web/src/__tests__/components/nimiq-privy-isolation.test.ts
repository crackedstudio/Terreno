/**
 * Guards the module boundary that keeps `@privy-io/*` — and the `x402` /
 * `@solana/kit` subtree it drags with it — out of the chunk Nimiq Pay clients
 * download.
 *
 * Nimiq Pay renders with the device's Android System WebView, which on the
 * phones this matters for is a 2018 factory build. Those clients get the
 * injected connector and never mount `PrivyTree`, so they can never use any
 * of that code — but webpack resolves static imports at build time, and one
 * named import from a module mounted by `TopBar` is enough to put the whole
 * graph on every page.
 *
 * This is asserted at source level rather than against built output because
 * it needs to fail in CI on the PR that reintroduces the import, not after a
 * production build. The realistic regression is someone adding `import { X }
 * from '@privy-io/react-auth'` back to the shell — or, more subtly, importing
 * something from a module that itself imports Privy, which is exactly how
 * this happened the first time (`PrivyReadyContext` used to live in
 * `wallet-provider-privy.tsx`).
