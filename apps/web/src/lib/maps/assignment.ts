/**
 * Terreno — map assignment, referral placement & migration
 *
 * Model: every wallet has ONE "home map" — where the UI drops them by default
 * and where load-balancing places them. The home pointer is:
 *   - set on first visit (referral target if valid+open, else freshest open map)
 *   - changed ONLY by an explicit migrate() call (surfaced at new-map events)
 *
 * The home pointer does NOT restrict ownership. Players can browse/buy on any
 * map; leaderboards are derived from on-chain ownership, so a migrated player
 * keeps their standing everywhere they still own pixels. This module is pure.
